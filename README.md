## Features
* Notifications for food expiration
* Recipe suggestions for food items about to expire.
* Ability to upload personal recipes or write it directly in the app.
* Comments are available where users can write down their shopping lists or ideas on how to use up their food items.

### How it's made
This is a full-stack application using the following:
* [![MongoDB][MongoDB]][MongoDB-url]
* [![Express][Express.js]][Express-url]
* [![Node][Node.js]][Node-url]

### Optimization

* When food items are about to expire, recipes for those food items will be sent along with the expiration notifications.
* Personal recipes can be uploaded privately or publicly.
* Public recipes can be accessed by all users while private recipes will only be seen by the owner of the recipe
