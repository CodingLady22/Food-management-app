Food wastage is a major problem all around the world. This app helps reduce food wasteage by sending notifications to the user when food items are about to expire.

### How it's made
This is a full-stack application using the following:
* [![MongoDB][MongoDB]][MongoDB-url]
* [![Express][Express.js]][Express-url]
* [![Node][Node.js]][Node-url]

### Features

* Any food item inputted will show the number of days until expiration.  
* When the food item is 5 days from expiring, a notification will be sent daily to remind the user to use it before it expires. 
* Comments are available where users can write down their shopping lists or ideas on how to use up their food items.

### Optimization

* When food items are about to expire, recipes for those food items will be sent along with the expiration notifications.
* Personal recipes can be uploaded privately or publicly.
* Public recipes can be accessed by all users while private recipes will only be seen by the owner of the recipe
